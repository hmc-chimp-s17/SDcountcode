FINAL RESULTS: 6j SYMBOL CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS
================================================================

TOTAL VALID CONFIGURATIONS: 693

Breakdown by cycles removed:
  0 cycles: 480 configs (69.3%)
  1 cycle:  188 configs (27.1%)
  2 cycles:  24 configs ( 3.5%)
  3 cycles:   1 config  ( 0.1%)

================================================================
SPECIAL CASE: All t's connect to same type (a, b, or c)
================================================================

Total: 30 configurations (4.3% of all valid)

Cycle distribution for these special cases:
  0 cycles: 24 configs (80.0%)
  1 cycle:   6 configs (20.0%)
  2 cycles:  0 configs (0%)
  3 cycles:  0 configs (0%)

KEY INSIGHT: When all t vertices connect to the same intermediate
vertex type, the resulting graphs are structurally simpler and
never require removing 2 or 3 cycles!

CYCLE EXAMPLES BREAKDOWN
================================================================

cycle_examples/ contains all cases with 1, 2, or 3 cycles:

1cycle_*.png (6 files):
  - Special cases where all t's connect to same type (a, b, or c)
  - These are the ONLY 1-cycle cases in this category
  - Show simpler structure compared to general cases

2cycles_*.png (24 files):
  - All configurations requiring 2 cycle removals
  - Mix of various edge overlap patterns
  - Parallel edges highlighted in different colors

3cycles_*.png (1 file):
  - Unique configuration with maximum cycles
  - All 3 FIXED intermediate edges overlap with RHS
  - Highest symmetry case

CODE IMPROVEMENTS IN SDcount_v2.py
================================================================

✓ Cleaner organization with section headers
✓ Intuitive function names (build_adj, check_degrees, all_t_same_type)
✓ Single-pass analysis (collects all statistics at once)
✓ Automatic filtering of special cases
✓ Draws 1-cycle special cases to cycle_examples/ folder
✓ More concise output formatting
✓ Better documentation
